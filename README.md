Nu style DokuWiki template

This is an experimental DokuWiki template that I am working on. This is where I try out new ideas and concepts, and try to build something that is a bit "out of the box".

The current state of this template is "experimental", and many core features that you would expect from a template are not even touched yet. It is certainly not ready for production use...
